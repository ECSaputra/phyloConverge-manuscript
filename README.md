# phyloConverge -- fast, calibrated method for identifying genomics regions underlying phenotypic convergence at high resolution

phyloConverge is an R-based comparative genomics software for identifying phenotypic associations of genetic elements.  phyloConverge combines maximum likelihood estimation and phylogeny-aware permutation tests to detect significant convergent evolutionary rate shifts underlying phenotypic convergence, while calibrating for biases from phylogenetic dependence, sequence genomes, and correlations between genetic elements.
