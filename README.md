# phyloConverge -- fast, calibrated method for identifying genomics regions underlying phenotypic convergence at high resolution

phyloConverge is an R-based comparative genomics software for identifying phenotypic associations of genetic elements.  

phyloConverge combines maximum likelihood estimation and phylogeny-aware permutation tests to detect significant convergent evolutionary rate shifts underlying phenotypic convergence, while calibrating for biases from phylogenetic dependence, sequence genomes, and correlations between genetic elements. phyloConverge is able to analyze segments of nucleotides at a wide range of sizes, from scoring genes or conserved elements, to scanning entire multiple sequence alignments at nucleotide resolution with computational tractability.
